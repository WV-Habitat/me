.center[.font140[**How can we better predict tree species distribution?**]]

<br>

- Species Distribution Models (SDM) are not appropriated for trees

- But we can use *theory* to create **mechanistic models**

- What are the drivers of forest dynamics shaping tree distribution?

- Mathematical and statistical models to assess the effect of climate, competition, and forest management

# Chapter 1: State Transition Model

.center[![:scale 55%](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/willvieira/PhD/master/chapter1/img/fig1.png)]

- Derived from the metapopulation theory
- **B**oreal, **T**emperate, **M**ixed, and **R**egeneration ~ MAT + MAP
- Extension to include forest management practices
- Analytical equations, Matrix algebra, Jacobian approximation
- [STM R package](https://willvieira.github.io/STManaged/index.html); [Shiny App](https://github.com/willvieira/shiny_STM-managed)

# Chapter 2 & 3: Integral Projection Model

<br>
.center[![](images\ipm3.png)]

- Demographic models for 31 tree species from eastern North America
- $\lambda$ ~ [Growh + mortality + recruit] ~ climate + competition
- Non-linear hierarchical Bayesian models
- Stan: statistical programming language derived from C++
- High-performance computing (HPC)
- C.2: Random forest for sensitivity analysis
- C.3: Scale integration - from individual performance to the metapopulation

## Sampling design for monitoring boreal birds in Quebec

---
# BMS project

<br>
.pull-right[![](https://willvieira.github.io/sampling_BMS/studyArea_files/figure-html/fig-ecoregion-1.png)]


- National effort to develop a protocol to sample boreal birds
- Adapt and implement national design for the Quebec region
- Spatially stratified sampling approach weighted by:
  - Habitat
  - Cost
  - Legacy sites
- [Report](https://willvieira.github.io/sampling_BMS/)

.font120[**Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG)**]

It is based on two complementary frameworks:
1. Optimal GeoTIFF storage (store and organize each pixel information)
  - Tiling
  - Overviews
2. HTTP GET range requests
  - extract only a portion of the GeoTIFF file
  - Not mandatory but already built into cloud services (Google, Azure)
  - Ranges are determined by external metadata

---
# Cloud-based geospatial technologies

<br>

.font120[**Spatial-Temporal Asset Catalog (STAC)**]
- A common language to describe geospatial information
- metadata standard (JSON)
- Structured metadata repository describing
  - **What** it is
  - **Where** data is located
  - **How** it can be used
-  Hierarchically structured into items, collections, and catalogs

Example with the Landsat images:
- RED band of an image is an asset
- All color bands of an image is an item
- All images together are a collection

---
# Cloud-based geospatial technologies

<br>

.font120[**Why should we move towards STAC?**]
- Once linked to STAC, we have access to any [new] open data effortless
- Catalog is centralized, providing easy searchability of new data sets
- Inclusion of new data is easy
- Community-based metadata extensions for specific problems

--

.font120[**Constrants**]
- It comes with high implementation costs (especially if we become data providers)
- Less useful if we are interested in only a few spatial datasets
